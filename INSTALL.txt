Compiling D2X-Rebirth Sourcecode

This file describes how to compile D2X-Rebirth from Source.


Requirements:
=============

   1. C/C++ compiler (gcc/g++)
   2. SCons (to compile in *NIX/Win32) / XCode (to compile on MacOS)
   3. SDL(-devel)
   4. PhysFS(-devel)
   5. GLU/GL
   6. NASM (optional for Assembler-based Texture-mapper in non-OpenGL Build)
   7. SDL_mixer(-devel) (+ dependencies) for external music support


Compiling:
==========

   *NIX:
   -----
   Type 'scons' to compile the source.
   You can also give additional options like 'scons sdl_only=1 asm=1'. See 'scons -h' for available options.
   To install, use 'scons install' but remember to use all your options as well or SCons will re-compile and
   install without any options given to prior compiling. However it's STRONGLY recommended NOT to use the
   'install' argument but to create a package for your Linux distribution or operating system. 'install' will
   compile the resulting binary (d2x-rebirth-gl/sdl) to /usr/local/bin/ by default so to uninstall, just
   delete the binary.

   MacOS:
   ------ 
   For Mac OS X, an Xcode project is available (requires Xcode 2.1 or later). Xcode includes the compiler
   and OpenGL. For Mac OS 9, an MPW Makefile is available. MPW includes the compiler. For the sources to
   compile, they will need to be made into text files using a typecode changing program, if they were
   downloaded outside of Mac OS 9 (including Mac OS X). This will also need to be done after any Terminal
   command (diff, svn update etc) edits the source files.
   SCons also works on MacOS, but it's recommended to use XCode instead.
   Note that there are ready-to-go packages on http://www.dxx-rebirth.com   

   Win32:
   ------
   Use the SCons way like described in the *NIX-instructions from an MSYS/MinGW environment. However you will
   not need to use 'install' but just drag the resulting binary to your Descent-folder.
   Note that there are ready-to-go packages on http://www.dxx-rebirth.com 
   

Needed files:
=============

   Since D2X-Rebirth is a Sourceport of the Descent2-Engine you will need the Game-Content data files to run
   the game. You don't own the full game, yet?
   Just visit GOOD OLD GAMES via:
   http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/descent_1_descent_2/pp/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291
   and download it for a very low price! DRM-FREE!

   Following files are needed to run the game:
   descent2.ham
   descent2.hog
   descent2.s11
   descent2.s22
   alien1.pig
   alien2.pig
   fire.pig
   groupa.pig
   ice.pig
   water.pig
   intro-h.mvl and/or intro-l.mvl
   other-h.mvl and/or other-l.mvl
   robots-h.mvl and/or robots-l.mvl

   With the PC version, these files - except the Movies (*.mvl) - are archived in the file
   'descent2.sow' on the Descent2 CD-Rom.
   This is an ARJ-archive and can be extracted with an adapted archiver like ‘unarj’ or by installing the
   game on a Windows/DOS system. Otherwise, for the Mac CD-ROM, the data files will need to be installed
   from the CD using a Mac system earler than OS X. Classic will work. If you know of any other way, please
   tell me at chris at icculus.org.

   Note that the above files must be lowercase if you use an operating system with case-sensitive file management.

Where to put these files:
=========================

   *NIX
   ----
   The Sharepath (/usr/local/share/games/d1x-rebirth/ by default - if not reconfigured via SCons) or
   ~/.d1x-rebirth or
   another directory specified by -hogdir via d1x.ini

   MacOS
   -----
   Same directory as where the binary is located or
   another directory specified by -hogdir via d1x.ini

   Win32
   -----
   Same directory as where the binary is located
   

Optional files:
===============

   D2X-Rebirth is expandable. You can add additional content to the game.

   Vertigo series AddOn
   --------------------
   Can be added by copying the files
   d2x-h.mvl and/or d2x-l.mvl, hoard.ham to your game-directory/Sharepath and
   d2x.hog, d2x.mn2 to 'missions/' subdirectory.
   All these files should be located on the ‘Vertigo Series’ CD-Rom

   Custom/AddOn missions:
   ----------------------
   Those can be found on several websites. Add them to the game by copying them to subdirectory
   ‘missions/’. They can also go in subdirectories of 'missions/', unlike with the original version.

   Language Packs:
   ---------------
   German translation: http://www.dxx-rebirth.com/download/dxx/res/D1XBDE01.zip
   Copy the txb-files to the Sharepath (non-Mac OS *NIX)/program directory (otherwise).

   Custom Music (like MP3 or OGG):
   -------------------------------
   Custom Music can be played via the Jukebox by specifying the path to your music in the Sound Options menu.
   Please note that all custom music has to be in 44Khz format.
   

Launching the program
=====================

   *NIX
   ----
   After compiling and installing, the program can be launched with the command:
   d2x-rebirth-gl
   or - if it has been compiled with SCons parameter ‘sdl_only=1’:
   d2x-rebirth-sdl

   MacOS
   -----
   Simply double-click "D2X-Rebirth".

   Win32
   -----
   Doubleclick d2x-rebirth-gl.exe

   To see a full list of available command-line options append ‘-h’, ‘-?’ to the command or refer file
   d2x.ini
