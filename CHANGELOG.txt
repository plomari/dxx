D2X-Rebirth Changelog

20090206
--------
INSTALL.txt, main/network.c, main/network.h, main/noloss.c: Small docs update; Noloss thinking flaw correccted: Add a special type for PDATA packets that need to be ACK'd so other clients won't ACK everything

20090203
--------
main/network.c, main/noloss.c: Close out fire from queue list as this is not necessarily needed to keep games in sync; While processing the noloss queue, only process 5 packets max

--------
main/newdemo.c, main/gameseq.c, main/gamerend.c, main/ai.c, main/game.c, main/gauges.c, main/game.h, main/gamecntl.c: Defined some default cockpit modes in Demo mode so we do not get invalid values when demo starts in non-default-view mode (as new HUD modes are only triggered at beginning and end of event); Removed Newdemo_flying_guided global; Init seismic disturbances in demo mode just to make sure tey are switched off when coming from game mode; Made initialisation for Missile_viewer signature saving global so we can reset it for each new level and make sure we get a correct missile view; Fixed regression in Ai_last_missile_camera
main/gamerend.c: Made FPS string statically right-justified - unrelated to actual FPS string width preventing jumps

20090201

20090129
--------
main/netdrv_udp.c: Decreasing delay from timer_delay2 to timer_delay for sending/receiving packets when connecting to UDP host due to FPS-dependent inconsistencies in timer_delay2 causing packets possibly not received or sent frequently

20090126
--------

--------
main/game.c: Removed some old code to smooth FrameTime we don't need anymore

20090122
--------
main/newdemo.c: New condition to switch to Interpolated demo playback - the old one did NOT make ANY sense at all

20090117
--------
arch/sdl/mouse.c, main/menu.c, main/playsave.c, main/playsave.h: Made MouseFilter selectable over Controls menu while defaulting to OFF - Saved in PLX

main/physics.c: Actually set velocity from movement when colliding with objects
arch/sdl/jukebox.c: Use a 2D array to allow playing of songs by track number in future
main/collide.c: Added some randomness to collision sound delays and synced robot-player collision sprites to same steps

20090108

SConstruct: prefix is now an argument (useful for auto-builds)
debian/*: created the debian packaging files

20081227

20081226
--------
main/netdrv_udp.c: Fixed segfault via buffer overflow when attempting to start or join a UDP/IP netgame.

20081223
--------
main/config.c: Make Redbook the default for Mac, because MIDI is buggy

20081221

d2x-rebirth.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, D2X.make, main/gamecntl.c, main/playsave.c: Fix Mac OS 9 compile issues, update Xcode project
arch/carbon/conf.h: Set SHAREPATH to "." for Mac OS X so reading data from DXX's directory ACTUALLY WORKS

20081213
--------
main/game.c, main/game.h, main/gamecntl.c, main/menu.c: Seperated help screens for game, netgame and demo; Also show them in Controls menu; Small Menu UI fix for ScrollOffset when calling menus in a scrolled area of a menu

20081212
--------
main/multi.c: Added /KillReactor command to blow up the reactor in Multiplayer games

20081207
--------
2d/pcx.c, 3d/interp.c, arch/include/key.h, arch/sdl/key.c, d2x-rebirth.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, iff/iff.c, include/gr.h, include/pcx.h, include/u_mem.h, main/automap.c, main/escort.c, main/game.c, main/gamecntl.c, main/gauges.h, main/inferno.c, main/inferno.h, main/kconfig.c, main/mglobal.c, main/newdemo.c, main/newdemo.h, main/newmenu.c, main/piggy.c, main/render.c, main/songs.c, main/titles.c: Get Mac command keys working, MACINTOSH code cleanup, update Xcode project

20081201
--------
main/kconfig.c: Restored vertical_thrust_time behaviour combined with slide_on to be inverted - respecting user's wishes

20081129
--------
main/state.c: Fixed the Birthday Bug: Correctly re-compute static_light when restoring a game - finally

20081126
--------
main/gameseq.c: Fixed logical code flow error when player dies in a secret level entered after base level destroyed which is also the last level
arch/ogl/ogl.c: Deactivated depth writing fo g3_draw_bitmap() sprites to prevent rendering errors when clipped in some cases

20081122
--------
main/kconfig.c: Completly forgot to make mouse axis values static so they can be used in intervals - shame on me!
main/fvi.c, main/pysics.c: Took out the "disable_new_fvi"-hack. After all we do not need that specific optimisation anymore and also without it we can have more accurate collisions with non-player objects. After playtesting for a while let's just do this.

20081121
--------
main/gamecntl.c, main/gauges.c: Do not allow to restore games while player is dead... again - to much trouble right now; Solving small display issue when fading out weapons which ran out of ammo
main/render.c: Increasing Render_depth to max. if OGL build (we probably should get rid of these variables, but may still be handy for non-3D-accellerated build optimisations)

20081120
--------
main/ai2.c: When we reached MAX_BOSS_TELEPORT_SEGS in init_boss_segments, make sure we also escape out of the for-loop - otherwise we still might overflow 
main/piggy.c: Corrected a small logical mistake in Shareware-HAM recognition
arch/ogl/ogl.c, main/ai2.c, main/object.c: Small transparency fix for robot weapons; Some timer-Failsafe in robot/boss dying frames; Fixed logical flaw in create_small_fireball_on_object() closing out sound effects on robots

20081119
--------
main/gamecntl.c: Actually demand ANY valid key to abort the Death sequence
main/songs.c: Do a songs_init() each time a song is played and try to read a new descent.sng - supporting descent.sng files in hog archives

20081118
--------
main/console.c: When printing Gamelog, make sure canvas is NULL
main/newmenu.c, main/multi.c, main/automap.c, main/gamecntl.c, ui/inputbox.c, ui/menubar.c, arch/sdl/event.c, arch/sdl/key.c, arch/include/key.h: Yet another UNICODE overhaul - Using seperate buffer for UNICODE chars and only use it in key_ascii() while still using keysyms for the rest of the program so we do not screw up readings by key values altered by modifers - possibly still room to optimize
main/gamecntl.c: Fixed cheats!
main/automap.c: Changed keys for Automap Viewing Distance to F9/F10 - Minus/Equal is not Layout independent

20081115
--------
arch/sdl/digi_audio.c: include/error.h, main/console.c, main/inferno.c: Added other SDL_(Un)LockAudio statements to protect the audio_mixcallback function - making that hopefully stable on multicores; Resetting warn_func at quit_request so we do not accidently show any menu; Open gamelog.txt unbuffered

20081114
--------
include/args.h, include/3d.h, include/rle.h, include/rbaudio.h, main/text.c, main/text.h, main/bm.c, main/gamefont.c, main/inferno.c, main/bm.c, main/bmread.c, main/piggy.c, main/render.c, main/render.h, main/songs.c, main/gameseq.c, main/gamerend.c, main/netdrv.c, main/endlevel.c, main/endlevel.h, main/terrain.c, main/terrain.h, main/polyobj.c, main/polyobj.h, main/game.c, main/gauges.c, main/texmerge.c, main/mission.c, main/mission.h, main/gamecntl.c, misc/args.c, 2d/rle.c, 3d/setup.c, SConstruct, D2X.make, arch/linux/alsadigi.c, arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/sdl/digi_mixer.c, arch/sdl/joy.c, arch/sdl/init.c, arch/sdl/rbaudio.c, arch/sdl/gr.c, arch/sdl/key.c, arch/sdl/digi_audio.c, arch/include/mouse.h: Using a clean flow for closing game data at the end of main() instead of using atexit; Now only use atexit for SDL stuff, error, mem, console (and editor which we do later); Small Cleanup

20081110
--------
main/credits.c, main/inferno.c, main/menu.c, main/newmenu.c: Small Cleanup: Using timer_delay for credits timer as timer_delay2 would respect VSync and change speed of the Credits scrolling; Cleaned that Start/Join Netgame cases up a bit; Removed the excessive use of atexit in newmenu... more to come
misc/error.c: When Error() is called, set Function_mode to FMODE_EXIT... basically to prevent the messagebox would try to render the game in background if the Error would happen while mission loading

20081109
--------
include/args.h, include/gr.h, main/gamefont.c, main/inferno.c, main/menu.c, main/gamerend.c, main/gauges.c, main/gauges.h, misc/args.c, d2x.ini, arch/ogl/ogl.c, arch/ogl/gr.c: Always keep aspect scaling (lowest scalar of width and height) for fonts, lines, dots, spheres, reticle and non-Cockpit-/Statusbar-related HUD-elements; Moved the Cockpit alpha decoding to gauges.c and created a seperate bitmap for the alpha fields and create subbitmaps from this one - more memory but this way we do not modify the cockpit bitmap itself

20081107
--------
arch/sdl/key.c: Only read UNICODE values from 31 to 254 to make sure we do not read any non-printable characters and prefer the keysym that way; Added left and right Command Key for MAC Keyboards

20081103
--------
misc/args.c: Fixed Typo
main/ai2.c, main/collide.c: Made move_towards_segment_center() use move_towards_vector() instead of just changing object position suddenly - smoother; Changed back the robot:controlcen collision back to original - the AI just relies to often on no-damage collisions, especially when our segment suddenly is a controlcen

20081101
--------
main/config.c, main/menu.c, main/newmenu.c, main/piggy.c: Fixed possible overflows in Jukebox Path; Menu GUI improvements: Correct inputbox scaling for font widths, a little performance boost when determinating string-part to show in inputbox, make it possible to flip over from first/last menu entry to last/first even if it's a ScrollBox, Scrolling via Maousebutton now works with delay; Made reading for Piggy data always break up in loops when reached end of file instead of provoking possible error if *data-count < max-data-count*
arch/sdl/key.c: Make sure that if we use UNICODE, we always take non-control type chars and - as we only want lowercase letters - convert chars if shift is pressed
arch/ogl/ogl.c. main/game.c: I always forget glLineWidth takes previous setting if arg is <1; Made the decodebuffer for cockpit static as the bitmap data pointer points to it

20081031
--------
main/bm.c, main/inferno.c, main/piggy.c: Allow hires Mac demo graphics, fix endian issue with reading GameBitmapXlat (fixing crash on PowerPC Macs using PC demo), put a return on the end of an error message
arch/include/key.h, arch/sdl/key.c, main/game.c, main/kmatrix.c, main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/newmenu.c, main/scores.c, ui/inputbox.c, main/menubar.c: Always use printable UNICODE characters for the key_handler and included routine to assign key symbols to UNICODE so we get an equivalent of a Key-Released state which we need for the Keyboard buffer; Removed the shifted_ascii_value field from key_props and stored all usable characters in seperate rows; Improves Text input and makes keyboard mapping independent from keyboard layout without breaking any compability
arch/ogl/ogl.c: Make glLinewidth depend on screen height, not width (for Widescreen monitors) (commit came with last revision, sorry)

20081030
--------
INSTALL.txt, README.txt: Docs update: Infos about Jukebox over SDL_mixer, SDL_mixer is not experimental anymore, yet another .de->.com change
d2x.ini, main/inferno.c: Show debug help screen options in release build as well as some might be actually useful for players
main/menu.c: Add a messagebox informing to restart the game if either VSync or 4x Multisampling has been (de)selected

20081029
--------
2d/font.c, main/gamefont.c, main/gamefont.h, main/menu.c: Scale fonts by float values and filter them if texture filtering is on; Another fix for the code flow in change_res() as the check for minimal custom resolution always failed
main/collide.c: Yet another check for collide sounds as FixedStep is not necessarily true if the actual collision happens
main/newmenu.c: Cast LINE_SPACING to integer for menu Scrollbox usages - fixing scrolling issues with non-integer-scaled font sizes

20081028
--------
arch/ogl.c, include/gr.h, main/game.c, main/gamerend.c, main/gauges.c, main/gauges.h, main/newmenu.c: Removed hack for Cockpit-window transparencies and added function to decode and add alpha to the bitmap directly (now works in non-OGL as well); Using sub-bitmaps for Cockpit-windows and menu backgrounds; Cleaned old bkg stuff from menu GUI
main/gamerend.c, main/manu.c, main/newmenu.c: Fixes for my last revisions: More reliable check for cockpit_decode_alpha, more reliable check is newmenu sub-bitmap needs to be re-created, call gr_set_mode() in change_res() with correct Game_screen_mode
INSTALL.txt, README.txt: Docs update: We moved from www.dxx-rebirth.de to www.dxx-rebirth.com!
arch/sdl/gr.c, arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/ogl/ogl.c, include/args.h, main/game.c, main/gamecntl.c, main/inferno.c, main/menu.c, main/playsave.c, main/playsave.h, misc/args.c: Cleanup: Renderstats; Made PRShot a non-OpenGL-related feature and added to Misc Options; Added command for SDL_ASYNCBLIT to command-line args
SConstruct, include/dl_list.h, main/config.c, main/console.c, main/menu.c, main/robot.h, misc/dl_list.c: Revisited Kip's non-Tracker changes and implemented to D2X: Prettier SConstruct output, Forgotten newlines at end of files, Improvement in dl_list code, Revamped menu GUI defines; I am NOT HAPPY I have to do these changes seperately!!!
